# PLTW Chapter1 Problem, Table 7, CSA5

In this project, you will work with your new table groups to plan and develop the escape room game within a VS Code/Github framework.  Each table group will make a copy of the [Milestone Template - PLTW Problem 1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rNya6NKHtUzVmxm1k2hS8meGkOAfnOJgOurdoolgT3w/edit?usp=sharing) to plan and document their development, and to assign project tasks to members of their group.  Groups should review the [Problem 1 Scoring Guidelines](https://instructional-resources.s3.amazonaws.com/PLTW_Computer_Science/30181_ComputerScienceA/English_External_Files/CSA_Problem1_ScoringGuidelines.pdf), the [Student Eval Form](https://forms.gle/aAAQmBYdByqHmwS98), and the [Gallery Walk Student Eval Form](https://forms.gle/aAAQmBYdByqHmwS98) to understand assessment requirements.  Note specifically, the requirement to include teaching points from PLTW assignments 1.1.2, 1.1.3, 1.1.4, and 1.1.5 in your class presentation, along with how your group used constructs from those assignments in your project.

Before starting your project, please review the [Github Tutorial on using VS Code with Github](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview).

Each group should decide on who will create the initial repository of the starter code, and how you will manage merging code.  Your Milestone chart should reflect tasks that are fairly independent so that your group minimizes merge conflicts. Your repository should be set to private, with perhaps a buildmaster, and normal contributors.  Each group can decide how they want to manage access, other than the fact that the repository should be set to private.

Each Table group will also create a google document to document their progress and share with the instructor.
[Spreadsheet with links to shared google documents (add your document link here)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11AtpxFrE1EsbSvR3EJLfROOkyGRRSgaJ5-eVg4mDu7Y/edit?usp=sharing)

The document should list all team members at the top, and provide a link to the team milestone chart and git repository.

Then, for each day of the project, the document should provide a date of the entry, summarize the daily activity including goals, major accomplishments, challenges, and notes of interest, in a daily log format. Also, include all callouts from the PLTW assignment that are entries to put into your PLTW Notebook. 

Deliverables (via a google slide presentation):

1) Each Team will provide an overview of their development process (walk through of the milestone chart)

2) Each team will provide an overview of unique features using screenshots, flowcharts, and, or pseudo-code.

3) Each team will provide a description of two program code segments related to the program requirements. Be sure your discussion identifies the name of the variables being processed.

NOTE:

As a separate assignment, each team member will also complete the [team collaboration evaluation form](https://forms.gle/DmBh1r467j9VRomaA) for this assignment.
